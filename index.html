        <strong>Chapel Thrill Escapes Terms and Conditions</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
        In consideration of my participation in the services of Chapel 
        Thrill Escapes, their agents, owners, officers, affiliates, 
        volunteers, participants, employees, and all other entities acting 
        in any capacity on their behalf (collectively hereinafter "Organization), 
        for the purpose of setting forth the exclusive Terms and Conditions by 
        which I desire to engage and participate in the services that the 
        Organization offers, set forth in these Terms and Conditions, I agree as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><u>Shoe Policy.</u> I understand and agree that as a condition of my participation 
            in an escape room of the Organization, I must remove any and all footwear 
            to prevent damage to the facilities of the Organization. I agree that my 
            failure to remove any and all footwear will prohibit my participation in 
            the escape room and shall not render myself eligble for a discount, full 
            or partial refund unless otherwise consistent with subsequent provisions 
            of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
        <li><u>Lateness.</u> I understand that the Organization in conducting smooth operations, 
            must ensure that impacts of lateness by a participant to a booking must be 
            minimized to both current and future participants. Thus, I agree that my arrival 
            at the location and premises of the Organization beyond my appointed booking time 
            may not qualify for the full allotted time as well as a full or partial refund consistent 
            with the Refund Policy herein or otherwise at the discretion of the Organization. I agree 
            that lateness shall be construed and defined as to mean fifteen minutes beyond the time 
            of my original booking.</li>
        <li><u>Damages.</u> I understand and agree that I will pay in full any damages the Organization 
            incures and suffers as a result of my direct or indirect action during my participation 
            of the services of the Organization. I further understand and agree that payment for damages 
            may be processed on my behalf using the credit information provided at the time of my booking. 
            I understand that my failure to make such a payment in the event of damages to the Organization's 
            facilities by my actions may result in adverse action consistent with Section 4 of these
            Terms and Conditions. I expressely agree that the Organization may retain my payment information
            including but not limited to credit card number, expriation date, and CVV code for the purpose 
            of exercising the provisions herein or other prudential purposes undertaken by a company or nonprofit.</li>
        <li><u>Dispute Resolution.</u> Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions,
             and/or my participation in the Organization's services, will be settled by Arbitration in 
             accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 1, 
             et seq. and when applicable the North Carolina Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (NCRUAA) 
             (N.C.G.S. §§ 1-569.1 to 1-569.3). All hearing will be held in Chapel Hill, NC before an 
             Arbitrator who is a licensed attorney. A judgment upon the award rendered by the Arbitrator 
             shall be entered in a Court with competent jurisdiction. The FAA and NCRUAA shall govern all 
             arbitration and confirmation proceedings.</li>
        <li><u>Non-Dislosure Agreement.</u> I acknowledge that my participation in the activities offered by 
            the Organization results in my obtaining Confidential Information. For the purposes of
